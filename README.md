# Short Project Notebooks

## About
Short Jupyter notebooks with various small projects or exercises. This was initially a place to upload notebooks done during or as homework assignments in the [Y-Data](https://yandexdataschool.com/israel/) program.

This repo will be constantly updated with new educational notebooks as they are done.
